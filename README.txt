Mandelbrot Surveyor is a multithreaded Mandelbrot fractal rendering program written in C++ using the SDL2 library.
As of now it features panning and zooming capabilities, but many more features are planned for future updates.

Planned future features:
  - GPU rendering using the CUDA toolkit
  - Smooth coloring algorithm
  - Dynamic color-palette choosing
  - Screenshots
  - Saving and loading of specific locations within the fractal
  - Cross-platform capabilities (should already be possible as SDL2 is cross-platform, but I haven't tested this on anything other than Windows 10)

Potential future features:
  - Dynamic rotation of the Mandelbrot
  - Implementation of other fractals such as the Julia, Buddhabrot and Burning Ship fractals
